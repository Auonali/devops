    <h1>McLaren Senna</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The McLaren Senna is the personification of McLaren’s DNA at its most extreme, creating the purest connection between car and driver. It is the most track-focused road car we have ever built, and it will set the fastest lap times of any McLaren to date. That is what has driven us to build a track car that is unashamedly without compromise. One that is legalised for road use, but not sanitised to suit it. Nothing else matters but to deliver the most intense driving experience around a circuit.</p>

    <h1>Bugatti P1</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>the P1 feels so together, so refined in its
reactions, that it makes the Texan wonder feel like a musclecar in comparison.
The Venom is excellent for the production of a manic grin, but the P1 would eat
it for breakfast in anything other than a straight drag race.</p>
